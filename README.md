# Glide Data Grid

We built [Data Grid](https://grid.glideapps.com) as the basis for the [Glide Data Editor](https://docs.glideapps.com/all/reference/data-editor/introduction-to-the-data-editor). It's a React component built on top of HTML Canvas.

-   **It scales to millions of rows**. Cells are rendered lazily on demand for memory efficiency.
-   **Scrolling is extremely fast**. Native scrolling keeps everything buttery smooth.
-   **Fully Free & Open Source**. [MIT licensed](LICENSE) so you can use Grid in commerical projects.
